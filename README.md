# The-7-Wonders
A simple application designed around building wonders before time runs out.

## Future Changes
- Points to modify stats at game start, perhaps with two random options of what to increase
- Modifier points have increasing costs the higher the stat
- Energy is calculated by endurance
- Instead of modifiers, stats determine how much you recieve from each decision
- Make stats and resources unable to go below zero
- If a stat isn't high enough to pay for a resource, make it unavailable, or penalize them for trying.
