# The-7-Wonders
A simple application designed around building wonders before time runs out.

## Future Changes
- Points to modify stats at game start, perhaps with two random options of what to increase.
- Modifier points have increasing costs the higher the stat.
- Energy is calculated by endurance.
- Instead of modifiers, stats determine how much you recieve from each decision.
- Make stats and resources unable to go below zero.
- If a stat isn't high enough to pay for a resource, make it unavailable, or penalize them for trying.
- Make a set list of wonders that are chosen at random and popped out of an array after they are built.
- Add additional characters.
- Each character has a unique option E that they can always use.
- Skip turn option if they can't access any resources. Gives some paltry energy.
- Add faith stat.
- Bonuses from completed wonders. Name and bonus appears at side of screen when complete. Either gives a stat boost, or a permanent unique question.
- Can build structures that last for a few turn and either give a steady supply of resources or temporary stat boosts.

## Fixes
- Inputting a wrong answer still progresses time forward.
- Every time you answer a question an entirely new prompt pops up.
